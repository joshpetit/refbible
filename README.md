## About
I wanted a way to quickly copy bible verses so I made one :). Still in development, but the main goal really is to just be simple, robust, and
easily shareable.

As of this writing the app can save favorites, query verses based on the contents of the search, and copy verses on query or on tap. 

One feature I anticipate adding soon is a tile icon for Android so that a console can be pulled up to query a verse or copy a favorite quickly.
I wish this could be implemented on iOS but I'm not sure that's possible yet. For ease of use I am looking into creating a combobox like input
ability also.
